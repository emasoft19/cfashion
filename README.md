A kitenji platform for local tailers to market and probably sell there fashion 
# 
I realised that there are very many people out there who are making cool fashions but there market places are limited to only where there workshops are,

I have a friend who is good at making the some fashions but I realised that her market is limited to only those people how passiby see the workshop and probably those who know about her good fashions. She has tried to make her markedt(fashion) via the social media platforms but I still thought that, that was also limitting in some way (limited to only those following her on social media).

Well, then I thought about a platform that could be used as a market place for the low level tailers who mark good fashions but have limited market

This won't be limited to only tailers "Bitenji", I was thinking of may be making a market place for people (ugandas) who sale local things for example crafts, name it.

I even thought that there could be market for such things outside uganda.

Platform will enable makers"Bitejists" to update the new fashions, there prices and perhaps the location of there workshops

I really need your thoughts about this,
Thanks
